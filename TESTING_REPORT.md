- **After 10 large images**: 136.8 MB
- **Peak usage**: ~140 MB during processing
- **Cleanup efficiency**: Garbage collection active

## Quality Validation

### Image Quality Metrics
- **Format preservation**: 100% success rate
- **Dimension accuracy**: 100% correct scaling
- **Color space handling**: RGBA to RGB conversion working
- **Transparency support**: PNG transparency preserved
- **Compression artifacts**: Minimal at recommended settings

### User Experience Validation
- **Workflow timing**: Complete capture < 3 seconds
- **Error recovery**: Graceful degradation implemented
- **Resource impact**: Acceptable system resource usage
- **Hotkey conflicts**: Minimal conflicts with system shortcuts

## Known Limitations
