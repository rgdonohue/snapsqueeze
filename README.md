## 🚀 What is SnapSqueeze?

SnapSqueeze revolutionizes your screenshot workflow by **automatically compressing and copying screenshots to your clipboard**. No more manually resizing images in Preview before sharing them in Slack, Jira, or GitHub!

### The Problem
- Default macOS screenshots are **huge** (often 2-10MB)
- Sharing large screenshots slows down team communication
- Manual resizing in Preview/Photoshop breaks your flow
- File attachments clutter your desktop

### The Solution
- **One hotkey** (`Cmd+Option+4`) captures, compresses, and copies to clipboard
- **Instant sharing** - just paste anywhere with `Cmd+V`
- **Smart compression** - 50-80% size reduction while maintaining quality
- **No files** - everything goes straight to clipboard

## ✨ Features
